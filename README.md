# Projects
This is a repository for all my Personal Code.

1. Project Hangman is a simple text based Hangman game I made to help improve the vocabulary of my friends who did not have English as a First Language. It was written using JAVA.
2. Dodgy Pipe Game is a completed group assignment that was assigned to a group of students (myself included) during the run of a Computer Science II course. We were asked to use simple GUI in JAVA to create an imitation of the popular tap game Flappy Bird. I cannot take full credit fot this as it was a group project I participated in.
